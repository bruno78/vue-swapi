# Star Wars Api

> A Vue.js project

### Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```

### Intro

Use the Star Wars API to generate a list of the films that a particular character appears in.

### Requirements

Submit an application that accomplishes the objectives below. Hosting is up to you, we only need a link to a working deployment of your project, and a link to your source code. We reccomend js bin and Plunker for free, all-in-one solutions.

Bonus points for SCM with github/gitlab/bitbucket + continuous integration and deployment to a real hosting service such as AWS, Google Cloud, or Heroku

### Objectives

- [x] Allow users to choose a character from the provided JSON file
- [x] Upon selection of a character, the UI should update to display information about each of the films that that character appears in. Minimally: Title, and formatted ('Thursday, May 19 2005') release date
- [x] Do this with any js framework, and some kind of component-based pattern
- [x] You can only use the API routes found the provided 'characters.json' file, and the data returned from those calls
- [x] Don't load the movie data until the character is clicked
- [x] Don't show any movie information until all of the character's movies have loaded
- [x] Handle HTTP errors
- [ ] Make it pretty! You're encouraged to use bootstrap or another css framework
